# Elon-Levy-Project-2
Implementation of the Hangman game along with decryption for the guessed word
The purpose of this project was to write code that would output the Hangman game. The game used a list of 10 encrypted words given in the prompt, hence the second part of the project which decrypted the correctly guessed 'word' into a real word. The game begins with a welcome message followed by a prompt asking the user to input their first guess (a letter). Then, the user will see a few messages stating whether or not the letter was in the word, the word the user is trying to guess but with "-" instead of letters, how many lives the user has left (they start with 10), and what letters they have guessed so far. If the user guesses a correct letter, the letter is filled into the word instead of a "-". If the user guesses an incorrect letter, they will lose a life. This continues until either the word was guessed correctly or incorrectly. If the user wins, they will then see the decrypted word as well as a congratulating message. If the user loses they will be notified that they lost and offered to play again in order to decode a word.
